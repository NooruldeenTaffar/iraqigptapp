# Iraqi Real Estate App Scaffold

This project provides a starter codebase for a full-stack real estate application targeting the Iraqi market. The backend uses **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**, while the frontend uses **React Native** with **TypeScript**. It includes placeholders for real-time messaging with Socket.io, JWT authentication with refresh tokens, Cloudinary integration, Arabic/English localization, and validation for Iraqi phone numbers and IQD currency.

## Structure

```
backend/   Node.js + Express API
frontend/  React Native mobile app
```

Each folder contains its own `package.json` for dependencies. After cloning, install dependencies:

```bash
cd backend && npm install
cd ../frontend && npm install
```
Run the development servers separately for backend and frontend.
